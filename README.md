## About

A open sourced, QR code scanner web app made for marking attendance during [SST Inc](https://www.sstinc.org/) sessions. Made with :heart: by [Ryan The](https://ryanthe.com/) @theboi using Next.js, React and TypeScript.

## How It Works

- Go to [qr.sstinc.org](https://qr.sstinc.org) or (Beta June 2020: [qr-sstinc-org.now.sh](https://qr-sstinc-org.now.sh)).
- Scan the QR Code provided by Inc Exco.
- You will be redirected to a Google Sign-In page.
- Sign in with Google using your SST Google Account.
- When you see the success pop-up, you may leave the page and (hopefully) rest assured your attendance has been marked.

## Installation (for development by SST Inc members)

- Clone (or download) the project from GitHub.
- In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run (you will need npm):
```shell
npm i
```
- Contact me to give you access to the Firebase project (you will need to be a member of SST Inc. to do this, obviously).
