## About

A QR code scanner site made for marking attendance during SST Inc sessions. Made with :heart: by Ryan The @theboi using Next.js, React and TypeScript. 

## Installation (for development by SST Inc members)

- Clone (or download) the project from GitHub.
- In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run (you will need npm):
```shell
npm i
```
- Contact me to give you access to the Firebase project (you will need to be a member of SST Inc. to do this, obviously).
